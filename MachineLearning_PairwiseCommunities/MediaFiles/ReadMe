This set of files is what was used to set up and eventually run all 5050 simulations in COMETS once a directory for each 
desired scenario was created.

Order of execution

cd to the target directory.

run makeLayouts.m (either from command line or from within an R environment with makeLayouts.r)

This will generate a layout file using compounds.m and ratios.m

compounds.m specifies which metabolites to use in the environment
ratios.m dictates the initial concentrations in COMETS.
