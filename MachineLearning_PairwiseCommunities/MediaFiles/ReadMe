This set of files is what was used to set up and eventually run all 5050 simulations in COMETS once a directory for each 
desired scenario was created.

Order of execution

cd to the target directory.

run makeLayouts.m (either from command line or from within an R environment with makeLayouts.r)

This will generate a layout file using compounds.m and ratios.m

compounds.m specifies which metabolites to use in the environment
ratios.m dictates the initial concentrations in COMETS.

layout.txt is an example of what the layout should look like.

The newest version of cometstoolbox may not use the same parameters. To replicate the results analyzed in the main text
ensure that the parameters are identical to the ones found in layout.txt
